    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Afghan Kabab is a traditional dish loved across Afghanistan, especially in Kabul and Mazar. 
        It is made by marinating lamb or beef chunks with onion, yogurt, and mild spices, 
        then grilling them on skewers over hot charcoal. The meat becomes tender, smoky, and full of flavor. 
        Afghan Kabab is often served with naan, fresh onions, tomatoes, and a special green chutney.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>500g lamb or beef (boneless, cut into medium cubes)</li>
        <li>1 large onion (grated, juice squeezed out)</li>
        <li>3 tbsp plain yogurt</li>
        <li>2 tbsp vegetable oil (or melted lamb fat for authentic flavor)</li>
        <li>2 tbsp lemon juice</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a bowl, mix yogurt, oil, lemon juice, grated onion (without juice), and all spices.</li>
        <li>Add the lamb or beef cubes into the mixture.</li>
        <li>Coat well, cover, and let marinate in the fridge for at least 3–4 hours (overnight for best taste).</li>
        <li>Thread marinated meat onto skewers.</li>
        <li>Optionally add tomato or green pepper between pieces for extra flavor.</li>
        <li>Heat a charcoal grill (traditional way) until very hot.</li>
        <li>Place skewers on the grill, turning every 2–3 minutes until evenly cooked and lightly charred (10–15 minutes).</li>
        <li>If no charcoal, you can use an oven (220°C / 425°F, 20–25 minutes) or a stovetop grill pan.</li>
        <li>Place hot kababs on fresh naan, top with onion rings, tomato slices, and sprinkle with lemon juice.</li>
        <li>Serve with green chutney or yogurt sauce.</li>
    </ol>
